    <p>Zamboanga del Sur benefits from its coastal access and inland fishponds, making fisheries a key industry. Coastal towns provide fresh seafood such as sardines, anchovies, shrimp, and crabs, while inland areas focus on aquaculture, especially tilapia and catfish farming. Fishing communities thrive in areas like Pagadian, Margosatubig, and Pitogo, where fish processing and trading are also common. This diversity in aquatic resources helps supply markets in Mindanao and even supports regional fish exports.</p>
